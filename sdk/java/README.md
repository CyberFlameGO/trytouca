Touca helps you understand the true impact of your day to day code changes
on the behavior and performance of your overall software, as you write code.

[![Touca Server](https://touca-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/touca-screenshot-suite-page.png)](https://touca-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/touca-screenshot-suite-page.png)

Touca SDKs let you describe the behavior and performance of your code by
capturing values of interesting variables and runtime of important functions.
We remotely compare your description against a trusted version of your
software, visualize all differences, and report them in near real-time.
